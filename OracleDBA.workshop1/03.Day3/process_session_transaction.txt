Be careful with increasing the number of processes, since it is related with sessions and transactions.

"SESSIONS parameter is the maximum number of sessions that can be created in the system. Every login requires a session.

It is calculated from PROCESSES parameter:

10g -> ((1.1 * PROCESSES) + 5)
11g-> ((1.5 * PROCESSES) + 22)

12.2-> ((1.5 * PROCESSES) + 22)

You may leave SESSIONS and let Database choose its value automatically."

TRANSACTIONS = (1.1 * SESSIONS)
